### All conversations and interactions should be respectful and harassment free

## Issues
If something doesn't work or you cannot figure out how to make it work, open an ``Issue``.

 See if the issue already exists, if it does either try to get help from the comments in its discussions or comment your specific needs. If it doesn't exist then open a new issue.

Some good things to structure your issue

1. Describe your problem as fully as possible
2. Include screenshots of what result is being shown and what you expected 
3. If possible include your local environment specifications 
4. If you want to suggest a new feature that doesn't exist, describe your suggestion as much as you can and tag the creator or core members of the repo to have a discussion.
